## Features

- The user is given a stock of 100 lives and
  needs to collect as many tacos as possible.
  Moreover, you must avoid being touched by
  any enemies.
- The game experiments with a computer-player that is
  supposed to follow and help the player collect coins.
  
  The computer-player uses a hill-climbing algorithmic approach by looking at all possible movements 10 pixels ahead determining which state is the most optimal based on how close the computer-player is with the main player.
